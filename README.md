CoRSV
So this is a project I wanted to work on:
Why RSV and Covid?
Well now that RSV is on the rise in 2024 mask use is becoming more important in doctor offices

I just wanted to see if there were similar rates between Covid and RSV, although RSV has been around for longer.

I'll update this README as I make more progress and outline it with goals

Current goal:
Determine path to make a relational database/ table from raw csv
Make relational database /table

Previous Goals
